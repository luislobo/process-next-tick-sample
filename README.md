# Process Next Tick Sample

This project explains the use of project.nextTick and the importance of using it in events.
It is also useful in callbacks.

Give it a try running:

```bash
node testStreamLibrary.js
```

That sample will print nothing to the console, while running:

```bash
node testStreamLibraryRight.js
```

will print all events into the console.
